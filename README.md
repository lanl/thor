# Tensors for High-dimensional Object Representation(THOR) / [Wiki](https://TODO)

This repository contains a novel, multi-GPU implementation of tensors in tensor train format.  It is based on the modern Fortran MPI/GPU communication library (Thunder), and a CUDA-enabled algebra of distributed arrays (DRay).

The THOR Project (Tensors for High-dimensional Object Representation) aims to advance the state-of-the-art in tensor calculations, manipulation, and research. 
We strive to provide a high-performance tensor library for various scientific applications, containing ready-to-use utilities and applicaions in Fortran, Matlab, and Python. 

Check our [wiki page](https://TODO) for introduction, getting started, etc.


## Installation

### MATLAB

Please download [TT-toolbox](https://github.com/oseledets/TT-Toolbox) package at the same directory level as THOR. Refer to individual application in for additional tools.

### FORTRAN (serial version in TNI/fortran)

* Clone the repo and change to `TNI/fortran` directory.
* In the subdirectory `config`, find a configuration that most closely matches your system.
* Copy it to `TNI/fortran` under the name `make.inc`. This is a system-dependent part of the Makefile.
* Modify it to match your compiler and the location of BLAS/LAPACK libraries.
* Build the code using `make`. Test using `make test`.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:lanl/thor.git
cd thor/TNI/fortran
cp config/gfortran.inc make.inc
# <edit make.inc>
make -j
make test # optional
```
