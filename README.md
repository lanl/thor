# Tensors for High-dimensional Object Representation (THOR)

This repository contains a novel, multi-GPU implementation of tensors in tensor train format.  It is based on the modern Fortran MPI/GPU communication library (Thunder), and a CUDA-enabled algebra of distributed arrays (DRay).

The THOR Project (Tensors for High-dimensional Object Representation) aims to advance the state-of-the-art in tensor calculations, manipulation, and research. 
We strive to provide a high-performance tensor library for various scientific applications, containing ready-to-use utilities and applicaions in Fortran, Matlab, and Python.
