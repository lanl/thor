## Tensor Network Integrators: Data

Some of the applications require large data that is not practical to store in this GitHub repo.
If you need these applications, please download the data to this directory, as follows:

```sh
cd thor/Tensor_Network_Integrators/matlab/data
wget https://github.com/lanl/thor-data/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip
```
This should create a folder `thor-data-main`.
